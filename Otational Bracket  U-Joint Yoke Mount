Technical Description:

This model represents a mechanical component shaped like a "U" bracket (yoke) commonly used to secure a rotating shaft or axle. Below are the details based on each image:

 Image 1:
A side view showing a semi-circular cavity at the base, indicating a possible location for a shaft or bearing installation.
The vertical arms extend upward with rounded edges.

 Image 2:
A front view showing a circular hole on each arm of the bracket.
These holes suggest a shaft passes through to hold a rotating element in place.

 Image 3:
An angled view combining both the side and front perspectives.
Provides a 3D understanding, highlighting the symmetry of the arms and the cavity at the base.
